calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability

data might not be accurate due to difference in the amount of times the songs are played in
the top 100 list, a way to combat this is to multiply the calculations above by the amount
of times the song was played, summing them up(which is the "weighted sum" of the list), and
divide it by the total amount of times any song was played to get the "weighted average"
